# Project Overview

## Description
The goal of this project is to build and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds.

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
